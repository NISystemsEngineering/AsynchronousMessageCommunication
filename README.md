# AsynchronousMessageCommunication
The Asynchronous Message Communication (AMC) Reference Library is a  general purpose LabVIEW API for sending messages within a process,  between processes, and between different LabVIEW targets (systems on a  network) in a LabVIEW application.

###The "source" folder contains all the files required to build the AMC Library.  All the files are saved in LabVIEW 2009, so they should never be modified in a version later than 2009 unless we decide to stop supporting that version.

The main landing page for AMC is https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-10294
on the reference design portal, ni.com/referencedesigns

The dependencies, ni_lib_keyed_array and ni_lib_string are located here: https://github.com/NISystemsEngineering/LVTools-Palettes
